# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Learning Outcomes

1. Create a branch from the master branch on GitHub.
2. Add, commit, and push data to a GitHub branch.
3. Merge a branch with the master branch on GitHub.
4. Retrieve data from a GeoJSON file.
5. Make API requests to a server to host geographical maps.
6. Populate geographical maps with GeoJSON data using JavaScript and the Data-Driven Documents (D3) library.
7. Add multiple map layers to geographical maps using Leaflet control plugins to add user interface controls.
8. Use JavaScript ES6 functions to add GeoJSON data, features, and interactivity to maps.
9. Render maps on a local server.

## Module ClassWork

#### Basic Project Plan

##### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to visually show the differences between the magnitudes of earthquakes all over the world for the last seven days.

##### Tasks
To complete this project, use a URL for GeoJSON earthquake data from the USGS website and retrieve geographical coordinates and the magnitudes of earthquakes for the last seven days. Then add the data to a map.

##### Approach
Your approach will be to use the JavaScript and the D3.js library to retrieve the coordinates and magnitudes of the earthquakes from the GeoJSON data. Youâ€™ll use the Leaflet library to plot the data on a Mapbox map through an API request and create interactivity for the earthquake data.

## Programs

1. MapBox API
2. GitHub
3. CSS
4. Javascript
5. Leaflet Library
